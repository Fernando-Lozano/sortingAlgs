## This is just for fun

Helps me to brush up on different sorting algorithms

The intent is to make a few different sorting algorithms and displaying visually how they perform.

Might add timing

Will be displaying:
    Bubble Sort.
    Selection Sort.
    Insertion Sort.
    Merge Sort.
